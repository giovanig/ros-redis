In order to have a dynamic DNS client running on the car, we need first to configure a ddclient to be executed on it. This document is a summary of the one found at https://www.dynu.com/DynamicDNS/IPUpdateClient/DDClient .

The first thing to do, is to configure a DNS domain in the https://www.dynu.com website. Log in using the following user and password:

Login: watcar
Password: watcar2017

Then, go to DDNS Services in the Control Panel. We will see that a domain has been specified: skylineII.mywire.org . If you want to change the domain, you should add another entry there.

In the car, you just need to install a client and configures it the secure mode with ssl as described here:

Summary of installation steps:

1) Install libraries: ```sudo apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl```
2) Install client: ```sudo apt-get install ddclient``` 
3) Configure the ddlcient file, in /etc/ddclient.conf . Below you can find an example:

\# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf  
\#  
\# /etc/ddclient.conf

syslog=yes                                                   # Log update msgs to syslog.
