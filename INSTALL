Before running the code DAQ, the following two scripts need to be run.

    bash ros_install.bash 

Installs the appropriate version of ROS on the system if it is not already installed

    bash redis_install.bash

Installs redis and additional dependencies to the system, if not already installed. 

After this, consult the readme to make the appropriate cahnges to the configuration files.
